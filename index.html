              <h3><li>T. enabled campus</li></h3>
            <p>
              This involves the presence of fast internet connection in all the school PCs, Wi-Fi in the entire premise and smart technologies in the classrooms. When used in the right sense, the internet is a massive well of education where the required information is present in various forms. Students should be able to use this huge potential to complement their academic growth and must have access to it from all corners of the school campus. A modern institution is connected to the internet, that allows seamless surfing and zero hindrances to knowledge consumption.

            <h3><li> A multipurpose auditorium</li></h3>
            <p>Engaging in arts has both physiological and psychological benefits for growing students. And the best schools will thus have a multipurpose auditorium in their grounds that can accommodate all activities. From theatre to educational workshops, dance performances to public-speaking contests, students must have the freedom and the facility to display their talent to a wide audience. This will boost their confidence, which will show in their educational performance and also provide them a break from the monotony of an otherwise regular curriculum.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3><li>Discovery and exploration laboratories</li></h3>
            <p>The conventional science labs in schools are generally bound by the curriculum. All the discussions and the apparatus are in line with the prescribed syllabus. But what sets a modern school apart in the best state board school in Kashmir is the scope of taking the curiosity of the scientific minds further and giving the students the space to discover and explore. This is the purpose of such labs where interactions and learning have no bounds. Every topic under the sun can be scrutinized. The students can ask, answer and explore, in a group and all under an able guide.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3><li>Library with e-learning</li></h3>
            <p>Books have evolved from merely being hard copies. Now, the resources on the internet are as good as any bestseller. If libraries are seen as the learning hub of the school, then a modern library must have the facility of both hard-bound books and e-books. The schools must, therefore, house fast and working PCs in the library with subscription to the top e-libraries, magazines and other such educational portals. This will amplify the richness of the library, provide students with all the materials they will ever need and allow them to study on any topic that they want to feed their curiosity.</p>

            <hr>
            <h3><li>Our Teachers Are Adaptable.</li></h3>
            <p>Effective teachers need to be able to work in a constantly evolving environment and adjust their teaching methods based on the age of their students, the resources available and changing curriculum, practices and requirements.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3><li>Our Teachers Are Engaging</li></h3>

            <h3><li>Our Teachers Show Empathy</li></h3>

          <h2>Perfect Learning Environment</h2>
          <div class="features-image">
            <img src="img/pexels-pixabay-247819.jpg" alt="image" />
            <h3><li>Flexibility</li></h3>
            <p>
              According to Modern Learning Environments by Mark Osborne, Director of Leading Learning and a teacher, school leader and consultant for more than 20 years, both students and teaching staff should have the ability to combine two classes into one for team-teaching, split a class into small groups and spread them over a wider area. They should also have the ability to combine different classes studying similar learning areas.With the ability for school facilities to be flexible and adaptable, teachers can choose how they want their students to learn, and students can learn in a way that is best for them.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3><li>Openness</li></h3>
            <p>With moveable walls, flexible work spaces, more glass, and the strategic use of a common learning area, modern learning facilities are all about openness.Through a common learning area and flexible work spaces, schools can have central teaching. These areas give students access to what other classes are learning so that teaching and learning can be complemented and enhanced, according to Osborne.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3><li>Access To Resources</li></h3>
            <p>With each learning area or classroom, good facilities in schools allow spaces for many different activities.Whether it’s reading, group work, project spaces, a wet area, a space for reflection, or for presentations, both students and teachers have the ability to find the resources they need – whether it’s wireless or wired technology – when they need it.“[Through modern facilities], inquiries are shared, interventions devised collaboratively and reflections based on both self and peer observations, which leads to a more robust, continuously improving community of practices,” Osborne writes.In addition to flexibility, openness, and easy access to resources, it’s also important for learning environments to be clean and fresh to keep students motivated and focused.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3><li>Overall Quality</li></h3>
            <p>According to experts in the field of education, well-planned, quality school facilities have a lasting impact on the educational experiences and creative activities in which students and teachers are able to engage. Educational research (see section two) has clearly determined that the traditional classroom settings which most adults have experienced during their own education are not optimal.</p>
